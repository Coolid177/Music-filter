# Music-filter
This project reads all mp3 and flac files in the music folder and sorts them by genre in the output folder. If one song has multiple genres is is placed in multiple folders.

# How to run?
Place your music in the Music folder and run main.py. The program will create an output folder with all the music in. Note that if there is no "genres" metadata they will be placed in the 'various genres' folder.

# Why this project?
My father wanted something that could generate playlists. I figured that the easiest way would be too take a bunch of music and sort it by genre.
